# JLB Skills Assessment

Objective
---------
Develop a webpage that matches the mockup in `./assets/mock.jpg`.

The website should:
  - Look as close to the mockup as possible on the latest versions of the browsers: Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox at a screen width of 1920px.
  - Sections should animate in on scroll. This animation is up to you.
  - The hero image ( the image at the top of the page ) should randomly display one of the 3 hero images on page load.

Process
-------
I began by using Adobe Illustrator to get a rough estimate of the dimensions of the different components of the page. From there I was able to begin editing the HTML and Sass to create the flexbox layout of the hero section. Once the hero section was completed, I moved on to the collage portion of the page. I initial laid it out using a series of rows and columns with more rows and columns in them. However, I re-evaluated and decided that this was not the best method to use. I removed the nested rows and columns and opted for a more concise row > col > inner-row structure that allowed me to achieve the desired appearance. Once the collage was completed, I quickly added and styled the copy text to finish that portion of the page. From there I found a JLB video on YouTube, added it to the page, and positioned it on the page. The last step was to go back and add the JavaScript code to select a random hero background and add the animations when the page is scrolled.

Libraries
---------
To make my workflow more efficient, I made use of the [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) library created by [Daniel Eden](https://github.com/daneden/). This along with some simple JavaScript allowed me to quickly add the desired animations to the site.

Testing
-------
Following the completion of the site, I used my MacBook to test the site on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari before moving to my Windows PC to test the site on Edge and Internet Explorer, as well as testing again on Chrome and Firefox.

Remarks
-------
Thank you for allowing me to work on this assessment. I know that it has required me to learn a few new things as well as refresh myself on some things I may have forgotten.
